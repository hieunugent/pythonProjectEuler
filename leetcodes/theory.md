# backtracking:
- technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one peach at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problems at any point in time 
- can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination inorder to solve a computational problem
