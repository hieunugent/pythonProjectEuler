#brutal force :
# iterater all the coin type available and the find  out the final solution 
# and we must return the smallest step to do the change
# but this is Excess the limit time 
# using the Dynamic problem:
# not recalculate the already done step just used it 
#  store the step calculate it in array list 
#  only get the min step possible
