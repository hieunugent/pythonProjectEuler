# last step must be reach form the first index
# go backward to see how many step the current index
# need to have to go to finish line
# if the last step return 0 no need to move
# if the current index has value more then step it need replace by zero since the previous need only one or greater to reach the end 
#       from their point
#       zero stand for able to reach the end
# if  NOT add more step to current point and the next index
#       so the previous need more step to come to CAN REACH POINT
